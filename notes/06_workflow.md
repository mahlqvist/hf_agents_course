# Workflow

Alright, let's explore the **AI Agent Workflow**, a cycle defined as the **Thought-Action-Observation** cycle.

Imagine you're a detective. Not just any detective, a smart AI detective. Your job? Solve a case. But how do you do it? You follow a simple loop, **Think-Act-Observe**.  

### The Thought

Before making a move, you need to decide what to do next. You analyze the situation, consider your options, and pick the best step. This is where your brain, the **LLM** comes in.  

**Example:** "*Hmm... I need to find the missing cat. Should I check the backyard or ask the neighbor?*"  

### The Action 

Thinking is great, but thinking alone won't find the cat. You need to act! This means using your tools, like calling APIs, searching a database or running some code. Whatever tool you have, you use it.  

**Example:** "*I'll check the security camera logs. Let me pull up the footage...*"  

### The Observation

After taking an action, you get new information. Maybe the camera shows the cat running toward a tree. Now, you reflect on what you've learned. Did it work?  

**Example:** "*Ah-ha! The cat climbed a tree! Now, what's my next move?*"  

### The Loop

This is **AI's** **While True** moment, the **Thought-Action-Observation** cycle, because this doesn't just happen once, it loops! Just like a detective keeps investigating until they crack the case, an AI agent keeps looping until it reaches its goal.  

```python
not_solved = True

while not_solved:
    think()  # Decide next step
    act()    # Take action
    observe()  # Learn from results
```

And it keeps going, again and again, until the mystery is solved (or, in AI terms, the task is completed).  

This loop makes AI flexible. It doesn't just follow a rigid script, it **adapts** based on new information, just like a detective adjusting their strategy based on clues.  

Now, the real magic happens when you get multiple cycles running, improving each time, making the AI smarter and more effective. And that's how AI agents get things done!
