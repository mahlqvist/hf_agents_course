# Observations

Alright, so we know an agent can **think** and **act**, but how does it get smarter? Simple, it **observes** what happens next.  

Think of it like this: You throw a ball. You watch where it lands. If it hits a wall and bounces back, you get new information, there's a wall! That's **Observation** in action.  

For an AI agent, **observations** are the feedback it gets from the world.
- Did my action work?  
- Did I get the right data?  
- Do I need to try something else?  

After taking an action, an agent does three key things:  
1. **Collects Feedback**: It receives data that shows if the action was successful (or not).  
2. **Appends Results**: It stores the new information, updating its memory.  
3. **Adapts Strategy**: It uses that information to make better decisions next time.  

Let's say the agent checks the weather and gets:  
*"Partly cloudy, 15&deg;C, 60% humidity."*  

That's an **observation** and the agent stores this information and asks:  
- Do I need more data?  
- Am I ready to give an answer?  

This back-and-forth process helps the agent stay on track, learn from experience and adjust its actions.  

### Types of Observations  

An agent's observations come from different sources, just like how we get information from sight, sound or touch.  

|Type of Observation|Example                                             |  
|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|  
|System Feedback    |Error messages, success notifications, status codes.|  
|Data Changes       |Database updates, file modifications, new records.  |  
|Environmental Data |Sensor readings, resource usage, system metrics.    |  
|Response Analysis  |API responses, query results, computation outputs.  |  
|Time-based Events  |Deadlines reached, scheduled tasks completed.       |  

Observations are like **tool logs**, they tell the agent what happened after an action.  

Once an action is complete, here's what happens next:  
1. **The agent parses its action**: It figures out what function to call and which arguments to use.  
2. **The action runs**: The agent executes the task.  
3. **The result is stored as an Observation**: The agent remembers what happened.  

This looping process ensures the agent doesn't just act blindly, it learns from what it sees.  

### The Full Cycle: Thought-Action-Observation  

At this point, you've got the full picture. An agent **thinks**, **acts** and **observes**, over and over, refining itself every step of the way. That's how it stays aligned with its goal, **constant feedback**, **constant learning**.
